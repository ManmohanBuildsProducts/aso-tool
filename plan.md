# ASO Dashboard Frontend Plan

## Problem Analysis & Purpose
Create an intuitive, real-time ASO dashboard for B2B/wholesale clients that transforms complex app store optimization data into actionable insights. The application will focus on delivering AI-powered recommendations with a polished, modern interface.

## Core Features
- Interactive dashboard with real-time metrics
- Advanced keyword analysis with trend visualization
- Competitor tracking with side-by-side comparison
- AI-powered metadata optimization
- Review sentiment analysis with key insights
- Screenshot effectiveness analyzer with AI scoring
- **Standout Feature**: AI-powered "ASO Opportunity Score" - A unique metric combining keyword potential, competitor gaps, and market trends into a single actionable score
- Clean, Modern UI
  - Interactive dashboards with real-time updates
  - Dark/light theme support
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Drag-and-drop widget customization

## Technical Architecture
This application requires a proper directory structure due to its complexity:

Frontend:
- React with TailwindCSS for modern, responsive UI
- Chart.js/D3.js for data visualization
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Query for API data handling

## MVP Implementation Strategy
1. Initial Setup (use files_writer)
   - React project with TailwindCSS
   - Basic routing and layouts
   - Core component library
   - Authentication flow

2. Dashboard Framework (use files_writer)
   - Main layout components
   - Navigation system
   - Widget grid system
   - Theme implementation

3. Core Features (use str_replace_editor)
   - Real-time metrics dashboard
   - Keyword analysis components
   - Competitor comparison tools
   - Review analysis interface

4. AI Integration (use str_replace_editor)
   - OpenAI/Claude integration
   - Metadata optimization UI
   - Screenshot analysis tool
   - ASO Opportunity Score implementation

5. Polish & Optimization
   - UI/UX refinements
   - Performance optimization
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Final testing

## <Clarification Required>
1. AI Integration Requirements:
   - OpenAI API key availability
   - Anthropic Claude API access
   - Rate limits consideration
2. Real-time Requirements:
   - Update frequency needs
   - WebSocket vs. polling preference
3. B2B Specific Requirements:
   - Key metrics priority
   - Custom dashboard requirements
4. User Management:
   - Authentication method
   - Role-based access needs

## Development Notes
- Use files_writer for initial setup and components under 100 lines
- Switch to str_replace_editor for complex features
- Focus on UI polish and responsiveness
- Prioritize real-time dashboard experience
- Implement AI features incrementally
