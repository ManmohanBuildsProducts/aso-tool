## Technical Architecture
This application requires multiple files due to its complexity:

Backend:
- FastAPI for the server
- Separate modules for scraping, analysis, and AI
- SQLite for data storage (MVP phase)

Frontend:
- React with Material-UI
- Chart.js for visualizations
- Responsive grid layout

## MVP Implementation Strategy
1. Setup Project Structure (use files_writer)
   - Initialize FastAPI backend
   - Create React frontend
   - Setup basic routing

2. Core Data Models (use str_replace_editor)
   - App model
   - Keyword model
   - Ranking history model
   - Database migrations

3. Play Store Scraping Module
   - Implement basic scraping with rotating user agents
   - Store ranking data
   - Rate limiting implementation

4. Basic Frontend (use files_writer)
   - Dashboard layout
   - App management UI
   - Keyword tracking interface

5. AI Integration (use str_replace_editor)
   - GPT-4 powered analysis
   - Ranking improvement suggestions
   - Competitor analysis

6. Advanced Features
   - Historical trend analysis
   - Visualization components
   - Export functionality

## <Clarification Required>
1. What is the maximum number of competitor apps to track per user app?
2. How frequently should rankings be checked? (Affects rate limiting strategy)
3. OpenAI API key will be required for GPT-4 integration - should users provide their own key?
4. Should the system support multiple users or is it a single-user tool?
5. What is the preferred format for ranking improvement suggestions (PDF report, dashboard, email)?

## Development Notes
- Use files_writer for initial setup and basic components (< 100 lines)
- Switch to str_replace_editor for complex modules and feature additions
- Implement robust error handling for scraping
- Focus on UI polish from the start
- Keep the initial version focused on core ranking tracking
