## Core Features
- Daily automated Play Store rank tracking for specified apps (com.badhobuyer, club.kirana, com.udaan.android)
- Historical ranking data for base keywords (kirana, b2b, wholesale, distributor, fmcg)
- Smart keyword discovery using app metadata and Deepseek API
- Keyword performance analytics and traffic potential estimation
- Multi-user access for marketing team collaboration
- **Standout Feature**: AI-powered keyword opportunity scoring that combines ranking difficulty, traffic potential, and competitor success patterns
- Clean, Modern UI
  - Interactive ranking dashboards with trend analysis
  - Keyword discovery workspace
  - Team collaboration features
  - Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Architecture
This application requires a proper directory structure due to its complexity:

Backend:
- FastAPI for RESTful APIs
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- APScheduler for daily ranking checks
- Deepseek v3 API integration
- Redis for caching and rate limiting

Frontend:
- React with Chakra UI for modern, clean interface
- Recharts for interactive visualizations
- React Query for efficient data fetching

## MVP Implementation Strategy
1. Initial Setup (use files_writer)
   - FastAPI project structure
   - React application scaffold
   - Database models and migrations
   - Basic authentication flow

2. Core Backend Features (use str_replace_editor)
   - Play Store scraping service
   - Keyword tracking system
   - Historical data management
   - Team collaboration API

3. Keyword Intelligence (use str_replace_editor)
   - Deepseek API integration
   - Keyword discovery algorithm
   - Traffic potential analysis
   - Optimization suggestions engine

4. Frontend Development (start with files_writer, then str_replace_editor)
   - Dashboard components
   - Keyword management interface
   - Analytics visualizations
   - Team collaboration features

5. Integration & Polish
   - API integration testing
   - UI/UX refinements
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation

## <Clarification Required>
1. Deepseek API details needed:
   - API endpoint and documentation
   - Authentication method
   - Rate limits and pricing tier
2. Play Store data requirements:
   - Maximum scraping frequency allowed
   - Additional metadata fields to track
   - Historical data retention period
3. Team collaboration specifics:
   - User roles and permissions structure
   - Notification preferences
   - Report sharing format
4. Keyword analysis parameters:
   - Traffic estimation methodology
   - Ranking difficulty calculation
   - Success metrics definition

## Development Notes
- Use files_writer for initial setup and components under 100 lines
- Switch to str_replace_editor for complex features and integrations
- Implement robust error handling for scraping and API calls
- Focus on UI polish and user experience from day one
- Prioritize core ranking tracking and keyword discovery features
