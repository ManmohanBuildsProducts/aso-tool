# ASO Tool System Redesign Plan

## Problem Analysis & Purpose
The ASO tool requires a comprehensive redesign focusing on three key areas: UI/UX enhancement, data pipeline optimization, and system architecture improvement. The goal is to provide marketing teams with an intuitive, powerful platform that delivers actionable insights through AI-powered analysis and real-time monitoring.

## Core Features
- Unified Analytics Dashboard with Real-time Health Score
- Smart Action Center with AI-prioritized Tasks
- Visual Competitor Analysis with Market Position Tracking
- Predictive Keyword Optimization Engine
- Automated Metadata Health Analysis
- **Standout Feature**: ASO Impact Simulator - AI-powered tool that predicts potential ranking and visibility changes before implementing metadata updates
- Modern UI with:
  - Customizable widget-based dashboard
  - Interactive data visualizations
  - Dark/light theme
  - Mobile-first design
  - Context-aware navigation

## Technical Architecture
This application requires a proper directory structure due to its complexity:

Frontend:
- React with TailwindCSS for modern, responsive UI
- Chart.js/D3.js for data visualization
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Query for API data handling

## MVP Implementation Strategy
1. Initial Setup (use files_writer)
   - React project with TailwindCSS
   - Basic routing and layouts
   - Core component library
   - Authentication flow

2. Dashboard Framework (use files_writer)
   - Main layout components
   - Navigation system
   - Widget grid system
   - Theme implementation

3. Core Features (use str_replace_editor)
   - Real-time metrics dashboard
   - Keyword analysis components
   - Competitor comparison tools
   - Review analysis interface

4. AI Integration (use str_replace_editor)
   - OpenAI/Claude integration
   - Metadata optimization UI
   - Screenshot analysis tool
   - ASO Opportunity Score implementation

5. Polish & Optimization
   - UI/UX refinements
   - Performance optimization
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Final testing

## <Clarification Required>
1. AI Integration Requirements:
   - OpenAI API key availability
   - Anthropic Claude API access
   - Rate limits consideration
2. Real-time Requirements:
   - Update frequency needs
   - WebSocket vs. polling preference
3. B2B Specific Requirements:
   - Key metrics priority
   - Custom dashboard requirements
4. User Management:
   - Authentication method
   - Role-based access needs

## Development Notes
- Use files_writer for initial setup and components under 100 lines
- Switch to str_replace_editor for complex features
- Focus on UI polish and responsiveness
- Prioritize real-time dashboard experience
- Implement AI features incrementally
